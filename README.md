### Install Visual Studio -> Code Editor
Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

IDE ->integrated Development Enviornment. eg.HTML, JavaScript.<br />
VS cmd pallet- run editor applicaton

#### Search and Editor tool intallation-
Extensions -> Search -> eg. REST Client -> Install

### Introduction to Github
Source Code Repo- source code repository means a revision control system for source code, in order to control the access, creation, maintenance, modification and use of source code.<br />
Remote Storage

#### Github account creation 
Signup in Github.com by providing Email ID

#### Git CMD- Git Config           
```
git config --global user.email "man@gmail.com"

```

#### Github Repository Creation
Profile -> Repositories -> New -><br />
Repository Name<br />
Public Repo<br />

git commit -m "first update"     //comment
git push origin main             //Push the code to Github platform     
```

#### Git bash 
Run git commands<br />
Interacts with remote repository

#### Git
version-control

### PAT- Personal Access Token 
Github + Visual Code connection
Profile -> Settings -> Developer settings -> PAT -> Generate new Token

### OPerating System
Linux/ Windows/ MacOS

#### Basic CMD         
```
cd            //change directory

Morzila<br />
Microsoft Edge<br />
Safari<br />

### Nodejs
JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Enginee

#### Install and Config Nodejs

nodejs -v       //for version details

### REST API
REST -> REpresentational State Transfer<br />
REST Client is a method or a tool to invoke a REST service API that is exposed for communication by any system or service provider.<br />
Easy to update the data in the database at any moment.<br />
simpler than SOAP           //                                                      <br />

and its shows error msg     //error in coding so we can debug it                    <br />

### CRUD -> Create Read Update Delete   //Resource
Create-> POST        //The Create function allows users to create a new record in the database.(unsafe method)<br />
Read-> GET         //The Read function is similar to a search function. (safe method)<br />
Update-> PUT         //The Update function is used to modify existing records that exist in the database.(unsafe method)<br />
Delete-> DELETE      //The Delete function allows users to remove records from a database that is no longer needed. (unsafe method)<br />

### HTTP METHODS -> HyperText Tranfer Protocol
WWW is about communication between web clients and servers.<br />
Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses<br />
Web Client -> Cloud -> Web Server<br />

### npm -> Node Package Manager

#### npm is the world's largest Software Library (Registry).
The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.<br/>
Open-source developers use npm to share software.<br/>
Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.<br/>
npm is free to use.<br/>

#### npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer.
All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.<br/>
The content of package.json must be written in JSON.<br/>
At least two fields must be present in the definition file: name and version.<br/>

npm i express<br/>
npm i joi<br/>
npm i -g nodemon<br/>

### JSON ->JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data<br/>
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page<br/>
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand<br/>

### JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs<br/>
Data is separated by commas<br/>
Curly braces hold objects<br/>
Square brackets hold arrays<br/>

It is important for all web developers to have a good understanding of XML<br/>
